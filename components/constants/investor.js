It is predicted that by 2025, 50 billion IoT devices will generate an astonishing 11.1 trillion $ in revenue.  Every industry and occupation will be affected under the fast development of autonomous machines. Mckinsey (2017) calculated that 50% of all global working-hours can be automated with currently demonstrated technology already. This machine transition will have an impact on 30% of all jobs by 2030.
