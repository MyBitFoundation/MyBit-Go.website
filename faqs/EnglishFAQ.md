What industries are you targeting?

​	Initially we are focused on Autonomous vehicles, renewable energy solutions such as solar, cryptocurrency ATMs, cryptocurrency Mining, decentralised storage units and Smart IoT devices but any IoT device or machine that generates revenue can be integrated into the MyBit platform.

Section 3: The Platform
What is MyBit?

​	MyBit is an ethereum-based investment platform (DApp) which enables the direct investment into any revenue generating IoT device without relying on a middle-man, broker, or intermediary fund.

How does it work?

​	Similar to kickstarter or like investment platform. Users can log on and view assets to invest in. Smart contracts govern the entire process and act as a digital broker so you can be ensured the terms of your investment will be followed without any manipulation or interference.

Why would I use it?

​	MyBit is the first platform to streamline investments into the technologies of the future. To invest in these next generation IoT assets via another platform or service would involve sending your capital to a third-party fund which creates counterparty risk and exposes you to exorbitant management fees.

Who are the competitors?

​	Traditional investment funds are the main competitor but their only advantage is their existing client relationships.

What is the competitive advantage?

​	Traditional funds cannot compete with MyBit’s security, speed, and low fees because their business models and overhead infrastructure cannot easily be redefined to match MyBit’s benefits.

Is it secure?

​	On one end it is very secure compared to traditional funds because you are in control of your capital from start to finish and do not have to rely on a third-party to fulfill investment terms and entrust them with your money. All of this is automated with immutable blockchain-based smart contracts (or computer code that cannot be altered or manipulated in any form). On the other end of the spectrum Ethereum and Blockchain technologies are still largely untested and in their infancy which creates risks, so it is important for everyone to perform their own individual assessments.

Do I have to pay to use the platform?

​	Yes, there is a one-time fee required which differs based on features you wish to use. These one-time fees are paid in MYB and then the MYB is removed from the total supply.

How do I fund Assets?

​	It is as simple as logging onto the platform, finding the project you want to invest in, and sending Ether to the listed smart contract address. Then everything is automated and you will receive revenue distributions shortly after the asset begins generating revenue.

Who can fund assets?

​	MyBit scales to meet the demands of any user ranging from small individual investors to large institutional funds. Please note that users may be subject to different onboarding requirements based on investment amounts, legal structure (if entity), and location.

What currencies can I use to fund Assets?

​	Ether is the main form of funding, but we plan to integrate shapeshift or similar back-end conversion service to enable asset funding in any supported cryptocurrency with enough liquidity. In the future we hope to also implement fiat options.

How often do I receive revenue?

​	It is available for withdrawal at the discretion of the user. We aim to make our Blockchain powered, revenue distribution management system as real time as technically possible.

What currencies can I receive revenue in?

​	By default it will be received in Ethereum, but we will integrate a conversion layer to increase the amount of cryptocurrency options which it can be received in. In the future we plan to implement Fiat payment; However, that is subject to the cost-effectiveness and local regulations.

What is the onboarding process?

​	This is yet to be set in stone but we will be partnering with a compliance company to manage all onboarding and user KYC/AML. This can differ substantially based on location and capital amounts.

How do you establish fractional ownership on the blockchain?

​	Fractional ownerships is achieved by smart contracts and crypto movement recorded on the ethereum blockchain. Physical ownership is recorded through ownership of tokens in a smart contract. More units of cryptocurrency that are contributed to the initial whole of the funding requirement equates to more fractional ownership.

​	For example, if a solar panel costs 100 units of ether then contributing 30 units of ether to the smart contract results in 30 percent fractional ownership which are stored in the smart contract.

How will ROI be determined?

​	The ROI associated an Iot Asset will be determined by the installer or producer of the asset and reviewed by the MyBit team to increase accuracy. We cannot guarantee the complete accuracy of the ROI estimations; however, as more assets are funded on the the MyBit platform, the data will be aggregated and analysed to increase the future accuracy of ROI projections.

Is ROI accurate?

​	ROI is reviewed internally by the MyBit team to help ensure accuracy; however, MyBit cannot guarantee the ROI. The ultimate decision to invest based on the ROI and its accuracy is the responsibility of the investor. Investment ROIs will get more accurate over time as we accumulate more investment data via the machine learning practices we will implement.

How will tax credits and asset depreciation be handled by the platform?

​	Tax credits towards the purchase of solar are priced into the asset funding price. Personal tax credits and depreciation expense are left to the investor and we advise to seek the advice of a certified tax professional.

Can investors sell and transfer their shares of ownership?

​	Not with the initial launch of the platform. Implementation of this feature is prioritized after initial testing and scaling.

What happens when a dispute arises?

​	All terms are recorded immutably upfront in smart contracts before they are deployed. When any dispute arises it is up to the parties involved to solve it - we recommend seeking third-party arbitration.

Are there a minimum or maximum number of investor limits per asset?

​	The minimum number of investors is 1. Each lister of an asset will determine if there is a maximum number of investors. Once a smart contract reaches its full funding requirement then the asset is locked from any further investments effectively capping off the number of investors.

How do you handle depreciation?

​	When choosing partners who will be listing their assets on the MyBit platform we review that the rate of revenue generation is greater than the rate of depreciation + operating expenses (projected)? This ensures that more profits are coming in than being lost to expenses and depreciation and that the total revenue generated over the asset's "normal" lifespan exceeds the cost of the asset. The majority of assets will be designed to operate (and generate revenue) until their lifespan is over, rather than deal with depreciated re-sale value. Therefore, we do our best to partner with companies whose assets can generate profits at a rapid rate to achieve full ROIs well in advance of the asset's life ending.

Section 4: The Token
What is the use of the MyBit Token?

​	MYB is a utility token which is used to pay the one time fee to access different features of the platform. It will also be used as escrow by the Asset Managers to incentivise them to complete their work as needed. Staking is also planned to be added in the future.

How does staking MYB work?

​	More information will be made available prior to the Beta Release scheduled for Q4 2018.

How do I trade assets I own?

​	Typically, investments such as this are illiquid - meaning that you often have to wait until the profits exceed your investment to gain a full ROI. Or you have to sell the asset in full to obtain cash. MyBit lets users sell a portion (or the full amount) of their ownership to someone else in exchange for cash. The buyer is willing to complete the purchase to capitalise on the existing and proven revenue streams of the asset. So there is potentially a whole business opportunity in taking the risk of funding assets with unproven revenue streams and selling them shortly after at a premium if revenues surpass projections.

Is MYB considered a security?

​	No, MyBit is a utility token used to access the MyBit platform. The MyBit platform enables investments into IoT devices, but the token does not directly which keeps it in compliance with regulations. Also, there is no truly passive revenue distributions purely from holding the MyBit token due to users having to participate in staking, similar to how Ethereum is migrating their structure.

What exchanges is MYB on?

​	MYB is currently on HitBTC, EtherDelta, and Cryptopia.

​	MYB can be traded with Ether on HitBTC and EtherDelta

​	MYB can be traded with Bitcoin on CoinExchange and Cryptopia

​	MYB can be traded with Litecoin on Cryptopia

​	MYB can be traded with Doge on Cryptopia.

Where can I store MYB?

​	MyBit can be stored on an exchange or any Ethereum wallet that supports ERC-20 tokens such as MyEtherWallet, Parity, or Mist.

How do I add MYB to MyEtherWallet and others?

​	You must add the custom token address via your wallet: 0x5d60d8d7eF6d37E16EBABc324de3bE57f135e0BC Additional parameters that may be needed include: name: MyBit Token , Symbol: MYB , Decimals: 18

Do you burn tokens?

​	Yes, one-time platform access costs which are paid in MYB.

How do I become a Brand Ambassador?

​	Send us an email with your location and experience in the crypto-industry and we will coordinate an interview with you.

What is the Vision?

​	The vision of MyBit is to disrupt traditional investing models. There is no need to trust a third-party with your capital and pay them a fee for something that can be securely automated with technology such as smart contracts. We also wanted to give people more power and freedom with their money so MyBit removes the large barriers to entry into the alternative asset investment space, largely the minimum capital requirements of funds. MyBit allows even the small, individual investor to capitalise on these opportunities which has never effectively been done before.

How was the idea conceived?

​	The concept of MyBit was first thought in 2016 of by Founder, Ian Worrall, who has a strong background in investments. His main strategy is to identify alternative assets that are largely unknown to mainstream investors that have high-yield potential (this is how he became involved with Bitcoin in early 2013). He identified that a major opportunity would be the upcoming machine economy that is projected to generate in excess of $6 trillion in revenue by 2025, but realised there was no efficient way for him to invest. His only option would be to send capital to a fund focused on emerging technologies and he was not a fan of trusting someone else with his money nor the excessive management fees they took. So with his background in investing and technology, as well as deep experience in Blockchain plus decentralisation, it made sense for him to pursue this venture which became MyBit.
