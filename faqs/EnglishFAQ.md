​	Initially MyBit will be conducting testing in Europe and Dubai. The first market MyBit will fully target is Europe, followed by Japan, China, Latin America, Australia, and North America. Dubai may be used as a testing bed for new products.

What industries are you targeting?

​	Initially we are focused on Autonomous vehicles, renewable energy solutions such as solar, cryptocurrency ATMs, cryptocurrency Mining, decentralised storage units and Smart IoT devices but any IoT device or machine that generates revenue can be integrated into the MyBit platform.

Section 3: The MyBit DApp Platform
What is MyBit?

​	MyBit is an ethereum-based investment platform (DApp) which enables the direct investment into any revenue generating IoT device without relying on a middle-man, broker, or intermediary fund.

How does it work?

​	Similar to kickstarter or like investment platform. Users can log on and view assets to invest in. Smart contracts govern the entire process and act as a digital broker so you can be ensured the terms of your investment will be followed without any manipulation or interference.

Why would I use it?

​	MyBit is the first platform to streamline investments into the technologies of the future. To invest in these next generation IoT assets via another platform or service would involve sending your capital to a third-party fund which creates counterparty risk and exposes you to exorbitant management fees.

Who are the competitors?

​	Traditional investment funds are the main competitor but their only advantage is their existing client relationships.

What is the competitive advantage?

​	Traditional funds cannot compete with MyBit’s security, speed, and low fees because their business models and overhead infrastructure cannot easily be redefined to match MyBit’s benefits.

Is it secure?

​	On one end it is very secure compared to traditional funds because you are in control of your capital from start to finish and do not have to rely on a third-party to fulfill investment terms and entrust them with your money. All of this is automated with immutable blockchain-based smart contracts (or computer code that cannot be altered or manipulated in any form). On the other end of the spectrum Ethereum and Blockchain technologies are still largely untested and in their infancy which creates risks, so it is important for everyone to perform their own individual assessments.

Do I have to pay to use the platform?

​	Yes, there is a one-time fee required which differs based on features you wish to use. These one-time fees are paid in MYB and then the MYB is removed from the total supply.

How do I fund Assets?

​	It is as simple as logging onto the platform, finding the project you want to invest in, and sending Ether to the listed smart contract address. Then everything is automated and you will receive revenue distributions shortly after the asset begins generating revenue.

Who can fund assets?

​	MyBit scales to meet the demands of any user ranging from small individual investors to large institutional funds. Please note that users may be subject to different onboarding requirements based on investment amounts, legal structure (if entity), and location.

What currencies can I use to fund Assets?

​	Ether is the main form of funding, but we plan to integrate shapeshift or similar back-end conversion service to enable asset funding in any supported cryptocurrency with enough liquidity. In the future we hope to also implement fiat options.

How often do I receive revenue?

​	It is available for withdrawal at the discretion of the user. We aim to make our Blockchain powered, revenue distribution management system as real time as technically possible.

What currencies can I receive revenue in?

​	By default it will be received in Ethereum, but we will integrate a conversion layer to increase the amount of cryptocurrency options which it can be received in. In the future we plan to implement Fiat payment; However, that is subject to the cost-effectiveness and local regulations.

What is the onboarding process?

​	This is yet to be set in stone but we will be partnering with a compliance company to manage all onboarding and user KYC/AML. This can differ substantially based on location and capital amounts.

How do you establish fractional ownership on the blockchain?

​	Fractional ownerships is achieved by smart contracts and crypto movement recorded on the ethereum blockchain. Physical ownership is recorded through ownership of tokens in a smart contract. More units of cryptocurrency that are contributed to the initial whole of the funding requirement equates to more fractional ownership.

​	For example, if a solar panel costs 100 units of ether then contributing 30 units of ether to the smart contract results in 30 percent fractional ownership which are stored in the smart contract.

How will ROI be determined?

​	The ROI associated an Iot Asset will be determined by the installer or producer of the asset and reviewed by the MyBit team to increase accuracy. We cannot guarantee the complete accuracy of the ROI estimations; however, as more assets are funded on the the MyBit platform, the data will be aggregated and analysed to increase the future accuracy of ROI projections.

Is ROI accurate?

​	ROI is reviewed internally by the MyBit team to help ensure accuracy; however, MyBit cannot guarantee the ROI. The ultimate decision to invest based on the ROI and its accuracy is the responsibility of the investor. Investment ROIs will get more accurate over time as we accumulate more investment data via the machine learning practices we will implement.

How will tax credits and asset depreciation be handled by the platform?

​	Tax credits towards the purchase of solar are priced into the asset funding price. Personal tax credits and depreciation expense are left to the investor and we advise to seek the advice of a certified tax professional.

Can investors sell and transfer their shares of ownership?

​	Not with the initial launch of the platform. Implementation of this feature is prioritized after initial testing and scaling.

What happens when a dispute arises?

​	All terms are recorded immutably upfront in smart contracts before they are deployed. When any dispute arises it is up to the parties involved to solve it - we recommend seeking third-party arbitration.

Are there a minimum or maximum number of investor limits per asset?

​	The minimum number of investors is 1. Each lister of an asset will determine if there is a maximum number of investors. Once a smart contract reaches its full funding requirement then the asset is locked from any further investments effectively capping off the number of investors.

How do you handle depreciation?

​	When choosing partners who will be listing their assets on the MyBit platform we review that the rate of revenue generation is greater than the rate of depreciation + operating expenses (projected)? This ensures that more profits are coming in than being lost to expenses and depreciation and that the total revenue generated over the asset's "normal" lifespan exceeds the cost of the asset. The majority of assets will be designed to operate (and generate revenue) until their lifespan is over, rather than deal with depreciated re-sale value. Therefore, we do our best to partner with companies whose assets can generate profits at a rapid rate to achieve full ROIs well in advance of the asset's life ending.

Section 4: The Token
What is the use of the MyBit Token?

​	MYB is a utility token which is used to pay the one time fee to access different features of the platform. It will also be used as escrow by the Asset Managers to incentivise them to complete their work as needed. Staking is also planned to be added in the future.

How does staking MYB work?

​	More information will be made available prior to the Beta Release scheduled for Q4 2018.

How do I trade assets I own?

​	Typically, investments such as this are illiquid - meaning that you often have to wait until the profits exceed your investment to gain a full ROI. Or you have to sell the asset in full to obtain cash. MyBit lets users sell a portion (or the full amount) of their ownership to someone else in exchange for cash. The buyer is willing to complete the purchase to capitalise on the existing and proven revenue streams of the asset. So there is potentially a whole business opportunity in taking the risk of funding assets with unproven revenue streams and selling them shortly after at a premium if revenues surpass projections.

Is MYB considered a security?

​	No, MyBit is a utility token used to access the MyBit platform. The MyBit platform enables investments into IoT devices, but the token does not directly which keeps it in compliance with regulations. Also, there is no truly passive revenue distributions purely from holding the MyBit token due to users having to participate in staking, similar to how Ethereum is migrating their structure.

What exchanges is MYB on?

​	MYB is currently on HitBTC, EtherDelta, and Cryptopia.

Where can I store MYB?

​	MyBit can be stored on an exchange or any Ethereum wallet that supports ERC-20 tokens such as MyEtherWallet, Parity, or Mist.

How do I add MYB to MyEtherWallet and others?

​	You must add the custom token address via your wallet: 0x5d60d8d7eF6d37E16EBABc324de3bE57f135e0BC Additional parameters that may be needed include: name: MyBit Token , Symbol: MYB , Decimals: 18

Do you burn tokens?

​	Yes, one-time platform access costs which are paid in MYB.

Section 5: Other
When will the Alpha be released?

​	It was released in private on May 10, 2018.

Are you hiring?

​	We are always looking for passionate innovators to join the team. Send us an email if you are interested in exploring full-time options or wish to become a Brand Ambassador.

What is a Brand Ambassador?

​	MyBit uses a Brand Ambassador strategy to have supporting members of our community host informational meetups around the world to spread awareness.

How do I become a Brand Ambassador?

​	Send us an email with your location and experience in the crypto-industry and we will coordinate an interview with you.

Section 6: Token Swap

Why is MyBit doing a tokenswap?

​	To ensure that the MyBit Ecosystem is able to effectively handle mass adoption, we need to scale up the amount of MYB in circulation. The new token has 18 decimal places instead of 8 so we can handle micro payments easier. Ether itself has 18 decimals and is the current industry standard. Another important update to the token is the total circulating supply metrics will now be dynamic. What this means is that every time MYB is burnt to access the MyBit Ecosystem, it will automatically be deducted from the current supply number on coinmarketcap and removed from total supply forever. This is a much more decentralised approach than with the current token model, and is critical to achieve our vision of a fully autonomous and decentralised organisation over the upcoming years.

What does the token swap mean?

​	It means we are swapping the circulating supply (2.8m) and the max supply (5m) are multiplied by 36x; to 100.8m and 180m. Nothing changes except for the supply.

Does this mean that my portfolio will go down or up?

​	MYB is a utility token used to access the MyBit Ecosystem, it is not intended nor designed for speculative purposes.

What do I need to do with my Tokens?

​	We advise you to take them off the exchange into one of the following wallets so you can swap them when the walkthroughs are published.
-MyEtherwallet
-MIST

Can I send my old tokens to exchanges?

​	 NO! We strongly advise you to get them to one of the above mentioned wallets and keep them there until you swapped them. After exchanges change the MYB token you won't be able to send your old tokens to them. 

When will the new token be listed on exchanges?

​ Exchanges are third-parties and unaffiliated with Mybit so we are unable to predict their actions. Please follow exchanges and/or contact them directly for clarification.

Section 7: MYDAX

What is MYDAX?

​ MYDAX is the MyBit Decentralised Asset Exchange which is the world's first Blockchain-based truly decentralised exchange for IoT Assets.

What can I use MYDAX for?

​	MYDAX is designed to securely create a market for buyers and sellers of historically illiquid alternative assets without relying on third-party brokers and agents to establish trust. This creates a more fluid, secure, and profitable user experience.

Will only assets funded on the MyBit DApp be on MYDAX?

​	No, the beauty of MYDAX is that any IoT asset, either those funded directly via the MyBit DApp or those already funded, deployed, and generating revenue can be tokenised.

Why would anyone want to tokenise an existing IoT asset?

​	Liquidity. A large risk in alternative asset investing is the lack of liquidity - the inability to easily, securely, and cost-effectively find a buyer/seller. MyBit streamlines this currently erroneous process with smart contracts.

How is it more secure and faster than traditional secondary markets?

​	By integrating Blockchain technology, we are able to automatically establish trust and proof of ownership so buyers/sellers are not reliant on third-party verification services to prove ownership (to the extent currently possible). Blockchain also creates transparency so financials can easily be audited (and trusted), and the exchange between ownership and cash does not require an intermediary which eliminates counterparty risk.

Section 8: Asset Manager & Staking

What is the role of the asset manager?

​ Many assets still require oversight, maintenance, and other operational requirements that are currently best completed by a human. The asset manager is rewarded with a percentage of the asset's revenue for his work.

Why reward the asset manager with a percentage of revenue instead of a fixed amount?

​ By taking this approach, it encourages the asset manager to complete his job to the fullest of his/her ability, as their work input should theoretically have a direct impact on their monthly profits. Fixed amounts often create complacency and laziness.

What percentage of revenue does the asset manager receive?

​ We believe in a free market approach where the asset manager can choose their percentage. We anticipate that it will typically range between 5-10% for an average asset. If the perecentage is too high, then investors will in theory not fund the asset, which will lead to an equilibrium percentage over time.

How are investors protected if the Asset Manager does not perform or meet requirements?

​ Investors of an asset can utilise our (anticipated) integration with Aragon to vote on removing an Asset Manager and replacing with a new one. This requires 51% of voting consensus.  Investors voting power is equivalent to their percentage stake in the asset.

Does the Asset Manager have any money at stake?

​ Asset Managers are required to lock MYB in escrow as collateral to incentivise them to perform their duties. If they are removed from their position, the escrowed MYB will be forfeited to the new Asset Manager.

When can Asset Managers withdraw escrowed MYB?

​ Asset Managers can withdraw MYB in proportion to the percent ROI the asset has generated. For example if an asset is at 25% break-even, meaning it cost CHF 10.000 and CHF 2.500 has been distributed to investors, then 25% of escrowed MYB is elgible for withdrawal. The percentages at which withdrawal is available are: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%. 

After Asset Managers withdraw 100% of their escrow what incentivises them to continue?

​ The monthly revenue streams they are receiving. It is important to note at this stage, Asset Managers have no financial-risk because they have received their full escrow amount back, but investors have received 100% of their initial investments back so the risk of any loss is mitigated.

How can I trust an Asset Manager?

​ Asset Managers will receive a trust level based on a proprietary trust algorithm we are developing.  This will also give suggestions as to the escrow range they should follow.

What if an Asset Manager cannot afford the average escrow?

​ This is where staking comes into effect. Hodlers of MYB can "stake" or post the required escrow for Asset Managers and in return receive a portion of the revenue stream assigned to the Asset Manager.

What percentage of revenue do Stakers receive?

​ Much like the free market model where Asset Managers can choose their revenue percentages of an asset they are managing, we believe that this should also be up to the discretion of the Asset Managers and Stakers. If an Asset Manager offers to low of a revenue share agreement, then in theory they will not have their escrowed covered by any Stakers.

How are revenue share agreements enforced?

​ Everything is done with smart contracts, so you can be sure it will function exactly as planned without any human risk.

When can stakers withdraw their staked MYB?

​ The same eligibility as Asset Managers - based on the revenue generated by the asset compared to the asset cost.

Can escrowed amounts be crowdfunded by stakers?

​ No stakers are required to post all or nothing. In the future we may implement crowdfunded staking, but currently it is not an option.

Are assets listed for funding prior to having escrow requirements met?

​ No, no assets will be listed to investors until 100% of the staking requirements are met.

In what form of payment is revenue received?

​ Ethereum by default; however, third-party conversion services may open up a variety of different crypto and fiat currencies which revenue can be received in.
